**Project Description** 

Currently public and private organizations are seeking to build diverse workforces, this includes cybersecurity workforces. While
most efforts focus on traditional career and training pathways. For example, several national efforts exist to encourage people to
pursue careers in cybersecurity represents a traditional approach to increasing the number of candidates for cybersecurity work and also increasing the number of candidates from historically marginalized populations. Due to the increasing demand of cybersecurity professionals in both public and private sector, companies are trying to understand the potential of candidates from non-traditional studies/fields (e.g., business, psychology) that have the knowledge, skills and abilities that ar ecompatible with cybersecurity-related roles. . Identifying possible groups of candidates with a high degree of matching between candidate KSAs and KSAs needed for a job would open up whole new groups to recruitment into cybersecurity positions. Additionally, close matches between candidate KSAs and those needed for the positions would indicate a population that would require little or no training and represent a cost-saving for the hiring organization.

Building a robust cyber workforce is nearly impossible if: 1) too few candidates with the necessary KSAs exist; and 2) recruitment is focused on areas with too few potential candidates and/or too much competition. Developing an understanding of if candidates currently exist and their approximate numbers would benefit both private and public organizations in their efforts to expand their cyber workforce and develop a more diverse workforces.  



**Project Goals** 

1. identify how many possible candidates with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) exist from non-traditional
fields/careers (e.g., business, psychology)

2. identify how many candidates from non-traditional fields/careers with the necessary KSAs fall into historically marginalized
populations, to include, but not limited to, Native Americans, rural Americans, and neuro-diverse individuals

3. compare and contrast by population demographics and field/career to include, but not limited to traditional fields (e.g.,
information technology)                                                               

4. identify locations (e.g., state, city) where candidates exist.
