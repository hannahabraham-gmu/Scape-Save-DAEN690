**Project Description** 

The demand for cybersecurity professionals continues to grow due to the public and private organizations' increased susceptibility to cyber-attacks. While the demand for cybersecurity professionals is highly reported, verifiable sources of the needs are lacking and the number of open positions available for cybersecurity-related roles varies from different sources. The lack of information on the demand and supply of cybersecurity professionals makes it difficult for organizations to estimate the timeframe for a vacant position to be filled. To understand the need for cybersecurity professionals, this study uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods to extract the job roles and location with the highest demand and extract demographic information regarding the current cybersecurity workforce. Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERTopic) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling methods are incorporated to gain insight on the trends and patterns within the cybersecurity workforce. Cosine similarity is used to compare the job descriptions from USAJOBS, Indeed and CareerOneStop with Knowledge, Skills, Abilities and Tasks (KSAT) from Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) to determine how closely employers are conforming to the guidelines of the NICE framework to develop their cybersecurity workforce. With the data collected, the approximate count is calculated to provide an estimate for the current demand and supply of cybersecurity professionals. The findings may assist organizations and current/future cybersecurity professionals to navigate through the process keeping up to date with the requirements and demand within the cybersecurity workforce.   



**Project Goals** 

1.	Develop a rigorous method for developing supply and demand estimates 
2.	Provide a current estimate of supply and demand using the method that includes demographic factors (e.g., location)
3.	Identify insights and patterns of cybersecurity professionals in the job market 
4.	Identify practical data and/or technological limitations (e.g., data about specific ethnicity does not exist)
